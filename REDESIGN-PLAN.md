# PlatWorks.tech — Website Redesign Plan

## Goals
- **Cleaner**: Molten glass card-like navbar; less visual noise.
- **Scannable**: Less words, more graphs/numbers; easier to understand.
- **ROI-first**: Hero and key sections focused on ROI and outcomes.
- **Content**: Reflect real audit deliverables, implementation examples, and target industries (College Station, traditional/boomer-owned).

---

## 1. Top Navbar — Molten Glass Card
- **Current**: Full-width bar with `nav-blur`.
- **New**: Navbar as a **floating card** (max-width, centered, rounded corners, margin from viewport edges).
- **Style**: Same glass treatment as site cards — `backdrop-filter`, semi-transparent fill, soft border, light inner highlight. Slight shadow so it reads as a card.
- **Behavior**: Sticky/fixed; same links (Services, Process, Packages, Why PlatWorks, Book a Call). Mobile: same card treatment on the hamburger panel.

---

## 2. Hero — ROI-Focused
- **Headline**: Lead with ROI outcome, e.g. *"See Your ROI Before We Build."* or *"Custom AI That Pays for Itself."* — one clear value proposition.
- **Subline**: One short sentence (e.g. quantified recovery: 15–25% capacity, payback in months).
- **Stats strip**: 3–4 numbers in a row — e.g. **15–25%** operational time recovered, **ROI** calculated upfront, **&lt;12 mo** typical payback, **8** audit deliverables (or similar). Big numerals, short labels.
- **CTAs**: Keep "Book a 30-Min Call" + secondary "See How It Works."
- **Trust pills**: Shorten to 3 tight phrases (e.g. "ROI-First" | "Custom AI" | "No Rip-and-Replace").

---

## 3. What We Do — Less Words, More Numbers
- **Section title**: Short. e.g. "What We Do" or "How We Create Value."
- **Intro**: 1–2 sentences max. Optional: one stat (e.g. "Most clients recover **15–25%** of operational time.").
- **Cards**: Keep 5 service cards but tighten copy; where possible add a number (e.g. "ROI targets before build", "Integrates with your stack — no rip-and-replace").

---

## 4. The Problem — Keep Short
- **Headline**: e.g. "Most Companies Run on Invisible Drag."
- **List**: 5 pain points (one line each).
- **Right card**: "We quantify that drag. Then we remove it." + one short paragraph + link. Consider adding one number (e.g. "Cost per occurrence, annual impact — no vague estimates.").

---

## 5. Process — ROI-First, 3 Steps + One Number
- **Steps**: Diagnose → Design → Implement (keep, shorten copy).
- **Stat**: "Most clients recover **15–25%** of operational time within months."
- **CTA**: "Book Your Strategic Assessment."

---

## 6. Audit Package — 8 Deliverables (What’s Actually Done)
Replace generic bullet list with the **exact 8 deliverables** (short labels + optional one number each where it fits):

1. **Deep-Dive Discovery** — Executive & ops interviews; process docs & time-consuming workflows.
2. **Full Process & Workflow Map** — Inputs, decisions, outputs, handoffs, failure points.
3. **Pain Point & Bottleneck Analysis** — Frequency, cost per occurrence, annual impact, staff impact.
4. **Automation Opportunity Report** — Per opportunity: solution, complexity (L/M/H), time/cost/quality savings, timeline.
5. **Full ROI & Business Case** — Direct cost savings ($), revenue uplift, error reduction, capacity increase; executive summary with total savings, investment, **net ROI %**, **payback (months)**.
6. **Prioritized Opportunity Matrix** — Impact vs. effort ranking.
7. **Phased Implementation Roadmap** — Quick wins (1–3 mo), medium (4–6 mo), strategic (7–12 mo).
8. **Presentation of Findings** — Current state, opportunity landscape, ROI summary table, next steps.

**Card copy**: Short intro line + numbered list (1–8) with bold title + one line each. Optional: "ROI & payback in the audit" as a small stat callout.

---

## 7. Custom AI & Software — Examples with Numbers
One subsection or row of **example implementations** with outcome-focused numbers:

- **AI Dispatch** — Technician utilization **+10–20%**
- **AI Estimating Engine** — Prevent margin leaks before bids
- **AI AR Automation** — Unpaid invoices **−30–50%**
- **Company Knowledge AI** — SOPs → internal AI assistant
- **AI Sales Proposal Automation** — Close deals faster

Format: Card or pill per example; **number** bold, one-line description.

---

## 8. Target Industries — College Station / Traditional
Add a short “Who we serve” block:
- **Focus**: Traditional, owner-operated businesses (e.g. boomer-owned) in **College Station** and region.
- **Examples**: Metal fabrication, Doors, Construction subs, HVAC, Manufacturing.
- **Tone**: One line: "Built for operators who want ROI, not buzzwords."

---

## 9. Packages (Free / Audit / Custom)
- **Free**: 30-Min Executive Call — keep; short bullets.
- **Audit**: Tie to the 8 deliverables above; "Recommended" badge; CTA "Request Full Audit Details."
- **Custom**: AI & software implementation; short bullets; CTA "Discuss Implementation."

---

## 10. Why PlatWorks + Final CTA
- **Why**: Keep 4 differentiators; shorten copy.
- **Download**: Audit overview PDF — keep.
- **Final CTA**: Headline e.g. "You Don’t Need More Tools. You Need Fewer Bottlenecks." + one line + "Book a Strategic Call" / Contact.

---

## 11. Visual / UX Notes
- **Numbers**: Use large, bold numerals in stat blocks and example implementations.
- **Graphs**: Where easy, add simple visual (e.g. horizontal bar for "Impact vs. effort", or a small roadmap timeline). If no chart library, use CSS (blocks, steps) to suggest structure.
- **Consistency**: Use same molten glass treatment for navbar and any new “card” elements; keep existing glass cards for sections.
- **Footer**: Unchanged or minimal (links, email, copyright).

---
